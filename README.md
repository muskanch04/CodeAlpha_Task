## üîë Key Features

### ‚úÖ Core Arithmetic Operations
The calculator supports all essential arithmetic functions:
- **Addition (`+`)**
- **Subtraction (`‚àí`)**
- **Multiplication (`√ó`)**
- **Division (`√∑`)**

These operations are executed in real time as users interact with the interface.

### üíª Intuitive User Interface
- **5-Column Layout:** The calculator follows a familiar 5-column button layout, providing a natural and user-friendly input experience.
- **Digital Display:** Inputs and results are displayed on a clear screen area that updates instantly as the user enters values or operations.

### üéõÔ∏è Comprehensive Controls
- **Digits (0-9) & Decimal (`.`):** Standard input for numerical values.
- **Clear (`AC`):** Resets all inputs and results.
- **Toggle Sign (`+/-`):** Inverts the sign of the currently entered number.
- **Percentage (`%`):** Converts a value into its percentage.
- **Backspace (`DEL`):** Removes the most recently entered digit or operator.
- **Equals (`=`):** Computes the full mathematical expression.

### üé® Styling & Design Enhancements
- **White Background with Black Text:** The default design uses a clean white background for the body, with black and colored buttons that pop visually.
- **Rounded & Pill-Shaped Buttons:** All calculator buttons are fully rounded, with the '0' button uniquely styled as a pill shape to match the double-width key on mobile calculators.
- **Color Coding for Button Types:**
  - **Digits and Decimal (`.`):** White
  - **Function Buttons (AC, +/‚àí, %):** Light Purple
  - **Operators and Equals:** Parrot Green
- **Responsive Design:** The calculator layout adapts to various screen sizes, making it fully usable on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Support
Users can perform calculations not only via button clicks but also through their **physical keyboard**. This feature improves accessibility and efficiency, particularly for desktop users.

### üîÅ Robust Calculation Logic
- Handles common mathematical edge cases, including:
  - **Floating-point precision issues**
  - **Division by zero**, displaying a clear `"Error"` message when necessary
- Ensures consistent and accurate results for every valid input expression.
